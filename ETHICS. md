# PrimroseAI — Ethics

PrimroseAI is governed by the following ethical principles:

1. Human-in-the-loop governance
2. Indigenous-led authorship and authority
3. No autonomous enforcement or decision-making
4. Protection of vulnerable individuals and communities
5. Transparency in purpose and limitation
6. Refusal of use for harm, surveillance, or exploitation

PrimroseAI is designed to assist humans — not replace them.
All outputs require human judgment and responsibility.
