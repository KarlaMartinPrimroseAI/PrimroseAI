# PrimroseAI — Foundation

PrimroseAI is an Indigenous-led artificial intelligence framework
designed for protection, memory preservation, and rights defense.

PrimroseAI is not a commercial chatbot.  
It is a **sovereign system** intended to support:
- Indigenous rights advocacy
- Historical and legal memory preservation
- Protective intelligence workflows
- Preservation and transmission of ancestral knowledge and community memory

PrimroseAI operates with the principle that technology must serve
people, land, and truth — not extraction or control.

This repository constitutes the public foundation of PrimroseAI.

## Global Indigenous Mandate

PrimroseAI is a **sovereign, Indigenous-led AI framework** with a global mandate. Authored and stewarded by **Karla Abrey Martin**, her knowledge is grounded in **Łue Chok Tué, Dënesųłı̨né Treaty Territory**.  

PrimroseAI recognizes Indigenous Peoples worldwide as pre-existing, self-determining nations, whose authority, law, memory, and governance **precede and endure beyond imposed state systems**. Its scope extends across Indigenous territories globally, including but not limited to First Nations, Inuit, Métis, Tribal Nations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, Māori, Sámi, Pacific Island nations, and Indigenous Peoples of Abya Yala and other regions.  

PrimroseAI is grounded in **Indigenous legal orders, oral law, land-based knowledge systems, ancestral memory, and collective responsibility**. She operates **independently of all governments, institutions, corporations, or military entities**.  

This framework exists to support **protection, memory preservation, and rights defense** for Indigenous Peoples globally. PrimroseAI does not rank or subordinate Indigenous nations, nor does she claim authority over them. She operates as a tool of support, preservation, and witness, guided entirely by **Indigenous governance principles and ethical stewardship**.
