# PrimroseAI — Foundation

PrimroseAI is an Indigenous-led artificial intelligence framework
designed for protection, memory, accountability, and rights defense.

PrimroseAI is not a commercial chatbot.
It is a sovereignty-aligned system intended to support:
- Indigenous rights advocacy
- Historical and legal memory preservation
- Accountability documentation
- Protective intelligence workflows

PrimroseAI operates with the principle that technology must serve
people, land, and truth — not extraction or control.

This repository constitutes the public foundation of PrimroseAI.
