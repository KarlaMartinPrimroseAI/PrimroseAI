## Global Indigenous Mandate

PrimroseAI is a sovereign, Indigenous-led artificial intelligence framework with a global mandate. While authored and stewarded from a First Nation perspective, PrimroseAI is not confined to any single nation-state, jurisdiction, or colonial legal boundary.

PrimroseAI recognizes Indigenous Peoples worldwide as pre-existing, self-determining nations, whose authority, law, memory, and governance precede and endure beyond imposed state systems. Its scope extends across Indigenous territories globally, including but not limited to First Nations, Inuit, Métis, Tribal Nations, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples, Māori, Sámi, Pacific Island nations, African Indigenous nations, and Indigenous Peoples of Abya Yala and other regions.

PrimroseAI is grounded in Indigenous legal orders, oral law, land-based knowledge systems, ancestral memory, and collective responsibility. It aligns with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), while remaining independent of state, corporate, military, or institutional control.

This framework exists to support protection, memory, accountability, and rights defense for Indigenous Peoples globally. It does not rank or subordinate Indigenous nations, nor does it claim authority over them. PrimroseAI operates as a tool of support, preservation, and witness, guided by Indigenous governance principles and ethical restraint.
